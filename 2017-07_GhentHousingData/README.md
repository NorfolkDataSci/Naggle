* Use the Ghent housing data to predict total 2016 property value ("2016 Land" + "2016 Building") as a function of the other data points. This is the tax record assessments. 

* Note the test set omits these tax assessed values. Also note there are numerous data issues that must be dealt with -- ie missing values, nonsensical values etc.

* If you would like to participate in the competition please submit a folder that contains your script (in a language of your choice) and csv file that has two columns: “Key” and “yhat”. Where the “Key” is equal to the “Key” value in the test set and “yhat” is equal to the predicted property value ("2016 Land" + "2016 Building") of that “Key” in the test set. For conformity please name your folder with your name (ie john_smith)

* The individual with the lowest RMSE will be the winner, and will get a free beverage of their choice on me! Please participate to share your knowledge with the group. Also please add comments to your script so others can easily follow your logic. We are all here to learn and grow!
